Tutorial
--------

Nonograms are logic puzzles that reveal a hidden image when solved.
Solve each puzzle using the numeric clues on the top and left of the grid.
Each number represents squares in the grid that are "filled" in a row or column.
Clues with multiple numbers mean a gap of one (or more) between filled squares.
Look at the first column. The clue is "5". Tap "fill" and fill in 5 squares.
The second column is harder. We don't know where the two single filled squares are.
Skip difficult rows or columns and come back to them later.
Look at the third column. The clue is "1 3". Fill one square, leave a gap, then fill three squares.
You can use the "mark" action to protect blocks that are supposed to be empty.
Tap "mark" and mark the empty square so you don't accidentally try to fill it in later.
